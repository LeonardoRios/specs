## Functionality 

### Syntax Highlighting

Syntax highlighting runs for all `.prisma` files as soon as you open them, and keeps the syntax highlighting updated permanently as you change the file.

The following elements of a schema file are highlighted:

- Model Blocks (`model`)
- Config Blocks (`datasource` and `generator`)
- Enum Blocks (`enum`) (not supported yet)
- Double and triple comments (`//` and `///`)

### Linting

Linting runs for all `.prisma` files as soon as you open them, highlighting invalid syntax or keywords in your schema file.

### Formatting

Formatting runs for all `.prisma` files on demand (Right Click -> `Format Document`) or if configured on save of the file.

Before formatting:

After formatting:

### Go to Definition

Go to Definition runs for all `.prisma` files on demand (Right Click on model type -> `Go to Definition`).

## Technical Implementation

### Installation

During its installation the extension downloads a zipped `prisma-fmt` binary for the user's operating system from a server and unzips it to an appropriate location the extension can access to execute it.

###  Syntax Highlighting

Uses syntax definition in `syntaxes/prisma.tmLanguage.json`.

### Linting

Uses a call to the `prisma-fmt` binary.

### Formatting

Uses a call to `prisma-fmt` binary.

### Go to Definition

Implemented as a language features using the `prisma-language-server`.
