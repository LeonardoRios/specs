## Repository Creation Guidelines

- In theory everything could live in one big, happy repo ðŸŽ…
- Split if clearly defined separate tool (e.g. `photonjs`, `lift`)
- Split if issues should be collected in separate location (e.g. `prisma-engines`)
- Split if separation necessary for technical reasons (CI, commits) (e.g. `prisma-engines`)
- Split if usage outside of Prisma could be useful (e.g. `prisma-query`)
- That being said, the current split and guidelines are somewhat arbitary and might change in the future
